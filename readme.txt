*** Project 2a Topological Sorting ***

Group Members;
      Jonathan Calderon Chavez
      Huiran Lin

EXTRA CREDIT:
We implemented both
-the DAG in the adjacency list format
-the topological sorting method using the queue-based decrease-by-one design method

Must have:
c++ 17

Instructions to run this Program:
         Run on linux/unix os because of the way my program indexes into a file.
	     If this program is run on blue, expect a long wait time (~1hr) for data9.txt,
	     3 mins on my laptop/mac (idk how this is possible).
	     
	     Any test files that you wished to test must be placed in the directory labeled "data",
	     or else the program will not work as intended.
	     	     No files are in the data folders, to avoid redundant downloads on your end.

	     Open terminal, and cd you way into the project directory.

	     File this project includes a make file

	     To build the project, enter make command on your terminal.

	     After the command finishes, to run the program enter the following command.

	     ./project2a.x

	     After the program finishes, the output will be outputted on console and in a file named
	     out+filename in the directory outData.

	     This is all information that you need to test this program.

         if running data9.txt on blue.
             expect the program to leave you on read on test data similar to data9.txt,
             but I promise you, the program will respond ... eventually.

             sit back and relax. listen to some jamz and drink a mangonada
